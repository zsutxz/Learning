THE STATUE

i have always known

1 just didn't understand
the inner conflictions
arresting our hands
gravitating close enough
expansive distamce between
1 couldn't give you more
but i meant everything

when the day comes
you find your heart

wants something more
than a vblece and a part

your life will change
like a s tatue set free

to walk among us

to create d estiny

we didn't break any rules

we didn't make mistakes
making beauty in loving

making lovin: for days

SHILOW
